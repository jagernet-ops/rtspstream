RTSP STREAM!

Creates a simple rtsp server to host video files locally stored on your device, then you can port forward
to watch videos and shows with friends across the internet. If your stream is studdery, mess with the bitrate setting in the main.py file to obtain a better frame rate.

Credit for the rstp server software goes to "alr9" as their program has saved me so much time...
